## Codes Included

### Regenerator.py

This code optimizes the variuos dimensions of a rotary regenerator implemented as part of a Brayton cycle.  The code can be run from the command line and requires no user input, but some parameters, such as the operating temperatures, can be modified in the code itself.  The CoolProp library is required to run this code.

Refer to the accompanying PDF for a more detailed explanation of the relevant physics and the overall numerical methodology.  It requires a minute or so to run the optimization, but all of the relevant parameters are shown in the output.  A sample output is shown below.

### Gasoduct.py

This code estimates the minimum cost of a hypothetical 900 mile long methane pipeline.  The code examines three different pipe materials (PVC, concrete, steel) and determines which of these would requiere the least cost.  The analysis was based on the amount of frictional pressure loss each pipe would experience.  The more frictional loss, the more compressors are required to maintain pressure in the pipeline.  So the main parameters begin optimized were the diameter of the pipe, the compression ratio of the compressors, the number of compressors used.  

The code can be run from the command line and requires no user input, but some parameters can be modified in the code itself.  The numpy array file "Compressor_Map.npy" must be in the same directory as Gasoduct.py for the simulation to run.  The CoolProp library is also required to run this code.

Refer to the accompanying PDF for a more detailed explanation of the relevant physics and the overall numerical methodology.  A sample output is shown below.
